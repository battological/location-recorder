Location Recorder
=================

Dumb little app to record your location.

Requires a `private.js` file that looks like:

```
var apiKey = yourApiKey;
var homeLat = yourHomeLat;
var homeLon = yourHomeLon;
```

`apiKey` is your Google API key.
`homeLat` and `homeLon` are the spot to initialize your map before locating yourself.
